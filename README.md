# UserScripts
A bunch of UserScripts (Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, etc) which I wrote or edited and personally use

## So what do they do?
I guess I'll describe some of the newer/better ones as I go.

### [Twitter image direct download.user.js](https://github.com/StelardActek/UserScripts/raw/master/Twitter%20image%20direct%20download.user.js)
Adds a little download button to every twitter image. Click it and directly download the :orig version of that file, which should be the largest version available. No need to open a new tab or anything.

### [Instagram image direct download.user.js](https://github.com/StelardActek/UserScripts/raw/master/Instagram%20image%20direct%20download.user.js)
Adds a little download button to every twitter image. Click it and directly download the :orig version of that file, which should be the largest version available. No need to open a new tab or anything.
